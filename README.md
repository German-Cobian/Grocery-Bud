# Grocery-Bud

A simple React app that allows users to input items they wish to buy at the grocery store...

![GroceryBud](/public/Enter-item.png?raw=true "Grocery-Bud")
![GroceryBud](/public/Item-entered.png?raw=true "Grocery-Bud")

... then edit a previously entered item, remove a specific item, or eliminate from the list all the items entered.
 
The app is based on the eponimous project that appears in the tutorial [Code 15 React Projects - Complete Course](https://youtu.be/a_7Z7C_JCyo) by freeCodeCamp.org.
